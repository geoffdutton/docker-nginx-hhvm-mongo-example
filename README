# We'll be using HHVM because it's fast as balls
# http://hhvm.com/

# download and install Boot2Docker: https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases

# you need to install VirtualBox first: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.28/VirtualBox-4.3.28-100309-OSX.dmg
# Using boot2docker https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/download/v1.7.0/Boot2Docker-1.7.0.pkg

# Here's the Docker docs that you won't read right now: https://docs.docker.com/

boot2docker up

# you'll see it has some output like below

# Waiting for VM and Docker daemon to start...
# .............ooo
# Started.
# Writing ~/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/ca.pem
# Writing ~/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/cert.pem
# Writing ~/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/key.pem
# Your environment variables are already set correctly.

# When you open a new shell/terminal window, you'll need to initialize
# the boot2docker environment variables, so I made an alias

# fill in your .aliases 
echo "alias initb2d='eval $(boot2docker shellinit)'" > ~/.aliases && source ~/.aliases

# Let's make sure we have our environment variables set, otherwise you'll see this crap:
# $ docker ps
# Get http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.19/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory. Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?

initb2d
cd ~/Projects/docker-nginx-hhvm-example

# build that bitch
# the -t means what we're calling/tagging this image as
docker build -t nginx-hhvm-mongo-example .

# you'll see a bunch of output, hopefully it actually works

# if you see "Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Abort", followed by "The command 'bin/sh -c sudo...'"
# it generally means you for the add the -y argument to the sudo apt-upgrade and/or
# sudo apt-get install in the Dockerfile

# you should see "Successfully built..."
# you'll see it listed if you run
docker images

# Now let's fire it up

# -t=false        : Allocate a pseudo-tty
# -i=false        : Keep STDIN open even if not attached
# --rm            : Will remove the container when we're done running, just do it
# -p              : The port that the docker virtual image will listen, i.e.
#                     the one we will connect to

docker run -it --rm --name our_first_run -p 9669:80 nginx-hhvm-mongo-example

# it will be running in the foreground, so open another terminal and type:
initb2d && docker ps

# you should see 'our_first_run'

# Now let's browser to it...
# 'boot2docker ip' gives you the IP of the virtual machine that's "hosting"
# the docker container we are running
open http://$(boot2docker ip):9669


# when we're satisfied, let's remove all open containers (there should be only one,
# but this comes in handy when you start really getting into it)

# docker ps : Lists the current running containers, the -a lists all of the containers
# Think of a container as a virtual machine instance that you can start and stop
# while a docker image is a "let's start from scratch and build it from the ground up"

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Finally, let's tag it with a version numbers to sort finalize the build
docker build -t nginx-hhvm-mongo-example:1.0.0 .
